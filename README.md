Developed and managed a comprehensive homelab environment to enhance my IT, DevOps, IoT, and cloud skills. Key components and services include:

- **Cloud Platform**:
  - **OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure)**: Utilized the Forever Free Cloud tier for hosting and testing various cloud services and applications.

- **SD-WAN**:
  - **ZeroTier**: Implemented software-defined networking for secure, flexible, and easy-to-manage networking across different locations.

- **Network Monitoring Systems (NMS)**:
  - **Observium**, **Zabbix**, **Uptime-Kuma**: Deployed for comprehensive network monitoring, with alerting capabilities using Uptime-Kuma.

- **Virtualization**:
  - **Proxmox**: Managed virtual machines and containers for efficient resource utilization and system isolation.

- **VM Backup**:
  - **Veeam**: Utilized free solutions for reliable VM backup and recovery processes.

- **Reverse Proxy/CDN/SSL**:
  - **Cloudflare**: Leveraged Cloudflare for reverse proxy services, content delivery network (CDN), and SSL management to secure web traffic.

- **Firewall**:
  - **Fortigate**, **OPNSense**, **pfSense**: Implemented these firewalls for robust network security and traffic management.

- **Containerization**:
  - **Docker**: Used Docker for containerizing applications to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
  - **Kubernetes (K8s, K3s)**: Managed container orchestration with Kubernetes for scaling and maintaining containerized applications.

- **Private Git Repository**:
  - **GitLab**: Set up a private Git repository to manage code and CI/CD pipelines.

- **Configuration Management**:
  - **Ansible**: Automated configuration management and deployment across multiple servers and environments.

- **Cloud Monitoring (Agent Based)**:
  - **Uptime Kuma**, **Datadog**: Monitored cloud resources and services, with Datadog providing limited free-tier services.

- **Free DNS Server and Ad Blocking**:
  - **Pi-Hole**: Implemented network-wide ad blocking and DNS filtering.

- **Network Scanning and Reporting**:
  - **Custom Script**: Developed a script (`nw-scan-report-webhook.sh`) to scan the local network and send reports using webhooks for real-time updates.

This homelab project has provided me with extensive hands-on experience in managing and automating IT infrastructure, cloud services, IoT devices, and network security, enabling me to design and maintain complex IT environments effectively.
